Firstly you can run all functions by command line.
Check functions and learn which args does it need, if you want run on command line.

run launch.sh for default configurations.

cd Bot1 and run node index.js for manuel execution.

You can pass debug and test count parameters like  "node index.js ${testCount} ${debug}".

You can find all test results in Bot1/performance_results.json file.

If you have questions, you can text me on whatsapp.
